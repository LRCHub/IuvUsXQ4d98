Am I in Sync? (x4)

Synthesizer rock ruled Jessica's feet
As a slave the that ubiquitous beat
Visions of the big screen danced in her head
'In a matter of time' she said
Jessie never got her Hollywood role
And the pogo nights have taken there toll
She can do the monkey off o' the cuff
But her mind had a missing link . . .

Am I In Sync?
Paint a picture on a subway train
Carve my name in a video game
Am I In Sync?
Out looking for the camera crews
Sell my soul for a second on the evening news
Am I In Sync?
Live 'til the bubble pops
Hold my breath when the big one drops
Am I In Sync?
Immortality is what I'm buying
But I'd rather be immortal by not dying

Laboratory rats made Roger a fink
And the laws of science drove him to drink
Working for the taste of public acclaim
And a cure that bore his name
Nobel prizes would have been nice
But he lost his mind to renegade mice
Roger traded dreams of 'Man of the Year'
For an understanding shrink . . .

Am I In Sync?
Paint a picture on a subway train
Carve my name in a video game
Am I In Sync?
Out looking for the camera crews
Sell my soul for a second on the evening news
Am I In Sync?
Live 'til the bubble pops
Hold my breath when the big one drops
Am I In Sync?
Immortality is what I'm buying
But I'd rather be immortal by not dying
