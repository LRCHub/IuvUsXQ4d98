I got pearls for girls
But I wish I had a penny for the poor I despise
If I touch, your skin
And you break my back
You bring tears to my eyes

Whiten the walls
They whiten the walls of Washington
Lip sync

I got shells as well
But I'm holding back my fire till they're in my sights
I got guns to run
Catch me running faster than a white boy's lies

Red as the roads
Running red as the roads of Birmingham
Lip sync

I got sex for sale
I'm trading in chains for the virgin brides
I got hell to pay
And I'm cracking like the whip for the dog I hired

Darken the doors
We darken the doors of Whitehall
Lip sync

Darken the doors
Lip sync
