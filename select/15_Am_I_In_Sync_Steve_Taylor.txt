Steve: I don't know Woody.
Are you sure you've got this think hooked up right?
Woody: Listen man, music is my life.
Steve: Alright. Two, three, four
Hey! What are you doing? What's goin' on?
Woody: Sorry.
Synthesizer rock ruled Jessica's feet
As a slave the that ubiquitous beat
Visions of the big screen danced in her head
'In a matter of time' she said
Jessie never got her Hollywood role
And the pogo nights have taken there toll
She can do the monkey off o' the cuff
But her mind had a missing link . . .

CHORUS

Am I In Sync?
Paint a picture on a subway train
Carve my name in a video game
Am I In Sync?
Out looking for the camera crews
Sell my soul for a second on the evening news
Am I In Sync?
Live 'til the bubble pops
Hold my breath when the big one drops
Am I In Sync?
Immortality is what I'm buying
But I'd rather be immortal by not dying.

Laboratory rats made Roger a fink
And the laws of science drove him to drink
Working for the taste of public acclaim
And a cure that bore his name
Nobel prizes would have been nice
But he lost his mind to renegade mice
Roger traded dreams of 'Man of the Year'
For an understanding shrink . . .

(CHORUS)

Steve: Alright. Let's try it again.
Woody, what are you doin'?
You told me you knew how to use this thing.
Woody: Sorry.
(CHORUS)

Steve: Alright. Get it right this time. Three, four.
Yeah now that wasn't so hard was it?
Woody, what's goin' on?
Woody: Sorry.
It's this machine.
You can fix it in the mix.
Listen, I kinda like it.
Have you ever heard of, uh, poly-rhythms?
I hear Bowie's gonna do this on his next album.
Steve: What a relief.
